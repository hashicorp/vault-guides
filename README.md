## Operations

This area will contain instructions to operatioanlize Vault.

- [Provision a Dev Vault Cluster locally with Vagrant](operations/provision-vault/dev/vagrant-local)
- [Provision a Dev Vault Cluster on AWS with Terraform](operations/provision-vault/dev/terraform-aws)
- [Provision a Quick Start Vault & Consul Cluster on AWS with Terraform](operations/provision-vault/quick-start/terraform-aws)
- [Provision a Best Practices Vault & Consul Cluster on AWS with Terraform](operations/provision-vault/best-practices/terraform-aws)

## Secrets

This directory contains example use cases involving [secrets management](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html).

## Identity

This directory contains example use cases involving [identity](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html).

## Encryption

This directory contains example use cases involving [encryption as a service](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html).

## Assets

This directory contains graphics and other material for the repository.

## `gitignore.tf` Files

You may notice some [`gitignore.tf`](operations/provision-consul/best-practices/terraform-aws/gitignore.tf) files in certain directories. `.tf` files that contain the word "gitignore" are ignored by git in the [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore) file.

If you have local Terraform configuration that you want ignored (like Terraform backend configuration), create a new file in the directory (separate from `gitignore.tf`) that contains the word "gitignore" (e.g. `backend.gitignore.tf`) and it won't be picked up as a change.

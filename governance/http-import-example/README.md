# Restrict Members of a Group with Sentinel
This guide illustrates how Sentinel and its [http](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http/) import can be used in Vault Enterprise to restrict the subgroups and entities of a group created in Vault. Specifically, it requires all subgroups and entities of a group in Vault to belong to the same namespace as that group or to one of its descendant namespaces (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.)

This is a good example of how the `http` import makes Sentinel in Vault much more powerful than it was before.

Note that the policies in this guide require Vault Enterprise 1.5 or higher since the `http` import was not included in earlier versions of Vault Enterprise.

Before starting this guide, you might want to read about Vault's [Identity Secrets Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/identity) and [Namespaces](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces). We also recommend reading about [Sentinel](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/) and how it is used in Vault in this [document](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel).

## Policies
There are two Sentinel [Endpoint Governing Policies](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel#endpoint-governing-policies-egps) (EGPs) in this directory:
1. [get-namespace-map.sentinel](./get-namespace-map.sentinel)
2. [restrict-namespaces-of-group-members.sentinel](./restrict-namespaces-of-group-members.sentinel)

Both of these policies should be created in the root namespace of your Vault cluster using the Vault UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

## The get-namespace-map Policy
The first policy, `get-namespace-map.sentinel`, builds a complete map of all namespaces in a Vault cluster. It returns a JSON map with the names of all Vault namespaces as keys and lists of descendant namespaces of the keys' namespaces as values. This policy can be invoked periodically to retrieve the current namespace map.

The first policy uses Sentinel's [http](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http/) import make calls againt the [/sys/namespaces](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/system/namespaces#list-namespaces) endpoint of Vault's HTTP API. This is done in the `get_namespace_map` function which is initially called against the root namespace ("") but calls itself recursively against each discovered child namespace until it has explored all namespaces.

The first policy should be applied against the path, `secret/get-namespace-map` in the root namespace of your Vault cluster. Since the policy always returns `false`, you can invoke it and obtain the current namespace map by running `vault read secret/get-namespace-map`.

Its output should be written with the `vault write` command to the static secret, `secret/current-namespace-map`. We show how to do this below.

## The restrict-namespaces-of-group-members Policy
The second policy, restrict-namespaces-of-group-members.sentinel, reads the namespace map generated by the first policy from the path `secret/current-namespace-map`. It then checks all subgroups listed in the `member_group_ids` attribute and all entities listed in the `member_entity_ids` attribute of the group being created and checks whether the namespace that subgroup or entity belongs to is in the list of namespaces associated with the parent group's namespace. The end result is that all subgroups and entities of a group must belong to the same namespace as that group or to one of its descendant namespaces.

The second policy should be created in the root namespace. It is applied to all paths in all namespaces that match `identity/group(.*)`. This is accomplished by actually applying the policy to the path `*` in the root namespace but then using Sentinel's [when](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/rules/#when-predicates) predicate to only do any significant processing against paths that match `identity/group(.*)`.

This is done with this `main` rule:
```
main = rule when request.path matches "identity/group(.*)" and
								 request.operation in ["create", "update"] {
  validate_group(request.data, namespace.path)
}
```

Like the first policy, the second policy uses Sentinel's `http` import to make calls against Vault's HTTP API:
1. It first calls the `secret/current-namespace-map` endpoint to fetch the namespace map.
1. Then it makes calls against the `identity/group/id/<subgroup>` API endpoint for each subgroup of the group being created. It actually does this against all namespaces until the group ID is found (which occurs when we get a `200` response code) because there is no way to query a group without knowing its namespace. We're essentially only calling the Vault API endpoint to determine the namespace the subgroup belongs to.
1. At that point, we check whether the discovered namespace of the subgroup is in the list of allowed namespaces associated with the group's namespace in the namespace map; these are the descendant namespaces and the group's own namespace.
1. Then the policy makes calls against the `identity/entity/id/<entity>` API endpoint for each entity of the group being created. Again, this API endpoint is called against all namespaces until we get a `200` response code which indicates that we have found the namespace that contains the entity.
1. At that point, we check whether the discovered namespace of the entity is in the list of allowed namespaces associated with the group's namespace in the namespace map; these are the descendant namespaces and the group's own namespace.

If any subgroups or entities assigned to the group being created are not in the group's own namespace or in that namespace's descendant namespaces, the policy fails and creation of the group is prevented.

## Using the Policies
To use these policies, you will need to run a Vault Enterprise server or cluster with multiple namespaces. You should also create a few groups and entities in different namespaces.

Additionally, you will need to replace `<your_vault_domain>` in the `vault_addr` parameter of both policies with the domain of your Vault Enterprise server or cluster and `<your_token>` in the `vault_token` parameter of both Sentinel policies with an actual Vault token in the root namespace of that server or cluster that has all of the following Vault ACL policies:
	* Policy to write to and read from `secret/get-namespace-map` and `secret/current-namespace-map`.
	* Policy to list and read against `sys/namespaces` in all namespaces.
	* Policy to read from `identity/group/id/*` in all namespaces.
	* Policy to read from `identity/entity/id/*` in all namespaces.

Here is a partial example of what such a policy in the root namespace might look like, but you would need to customize to adjust to your namespace map:
```
# Read from and write to secret/get-namespace-map
path "secret/get-namespace-map" {
   capabilities = ["create", "read", "update"]
}

# Read from and write to secret/current-namespace-map
path "secret/current-namespace-map" {
   capabilities = ["create", "read", "update"]
}

# Read and list namespaces in all namespaces
path "sys/namespaces/*" {
   capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
path "Sales/sys/namespaces/*" {
   capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
path "Sales/SE/sys/namespaces/*" {
   capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
path "Sales/CAM/sys/namespaces/*" {
   capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
path "CustomerSuccess/sys/namespaces/*" {
   capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}

# Read groups in all namespaces
path "identity/group/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/identity/group/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/SE/identity/group/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/CAM/identity/group/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "CustomerSuccess/identity/group/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Read entities in all namespaces
path "identity/entity/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/identity/entity/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/SE/identity/entity/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "Sales/CAM/identity/entity/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "CustomerSuccess/identity/entity/id/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

### My Namespaces
On my Vault cluster, I have multiple namespaces several layers deep. The hierarchy is as follows:
```
Root
   ├── CustomerSuccess
   │   └── Implementation
   └── Sales
       ├── CAM
       │   ├── East
       │   └── West
       └── SE
           ├── cloudy
           ├── east-SEs
           ├── midwest-SEs
           │   └── kcorbin
           └── west-SEs
```

This is what I get by running the first policy which I do by running this command:
```
vault read secret/get-namespace-map
```

This gives me the following output:
```
Error reading secret/get-namespace-map: Error making API request.

URL: GET https://cam-vault.hashidemos.io:8200/v1/secret/get-namespace-map
Code: 403. Errors:

	* egp standard policy "root/get-namespace-map" evaluation resulted in denial.

The specific error was:
<nil>

A trace of the execution for policy "root/get-namespace-map" is available:

one associated with namespace paths of itself and all
children namespaces

print() output:

```
which is followed by the namespace map to which I have added some line breaks below to make it easier to read:
```

{
  "":["","CustomerSuccess/","CustomerSuccess/Implementation/","Sales/","Sales/CAM/","Sales/CAM/West/","Sales/CAM/East/","Sales/SE/","Sales/SE/cloudy/","Sales/SE/east-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/","Sales/SE/west-SEs/"],
  "CustomerSuccess/":["CustomerSuccess/","CustomerSuccess/Implementation/"],
  "CustomerSuccess/Implementation/":["CustomerSuccess/Implementation/"],
  "Sales/":["Sales/","Sales/CAM/","Sales/CAM/West/","Sales/CAM/East/","Sales/SE/","Sales/SE/cloudy/","Sales/SE/east-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/","Sales/SE/west-SEs/"],
  "Sales/CAM/":["Sales/CAM/","Sales/CAM/West/","Sales/CAM/East/"],
  "Sales/CAM/East/":["Sales/CAM/East/"],
  "Sales/CAM/West/":["Sales/CAM/West/"],
  "Sales/SE/":["Sales/SE/","Sales/SE/cloudy/","Sales/SE/east-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/","Sales/SE/west-SEs/"],
  "Sales/SE/cloudy/":["Sales/SE/cloudy/"],
  "Sales/SE/east-SEs/":["Sales/SE/east-SEs/"],
  "Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/":["Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/","Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/"],
  "Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/":["Sales/SE/midwest-SEs/kcorbin/"],
  "Sales/SE/west-SEs/":["Sales/SE/west-SEs/"]
}
```

However, you do not need to add any linebreaks to the generated namespace map before writing it to the `secret/current-namespace-map` secret. You can do that like this:
```
vault write secret/current-namespace-map namespace-map='<generated_namespace_map>'
```
where `<generated_namespace_map>` is the json returned after "Complete Namespace Map". If this works, you should see "Success! Data written to: secret/current-namespace-map".

### My Groups and Entities
I have the following group IDs that I tried to add when creating a new group in the Sales namespace:
```
0eca3132-c0ec-5807-9014-549fc91fc99e in Sales/SE
c81732b0-cea3-3a6c-0a52-d3b4afaca440 in Sales/SE
e9e2a598-0a93-1759-8851-b1a191e6dd9c in CustomerSuccess
```

I have the following entity IDs that I tried to add when creating a new group in the Sales namespace:
```
870a6d92-10f0-55b2-805d-5a3411a8bdd4 in Sales
93c0685e-5082-2f10-96c8-d0d42c9b1527 in Sales/SE/east-SEs
96b1876e-dbc7-187a-956e-e4ff035798cd in the root namespace
```

The first two groups and the first two entities are allowed by the `restrict-namespaces-of-group-members` policy while the last group and the last entity are not.

## What The Policy Gives Me
I tested the `restrict-namespaces-of-group-members` policy with the following commands, after which I show the results returned by Sentinel.

The first command tries to create an invalid group since the third subgroup and the third entity are in invalid namespaces. This triggers a Sentinel policy violation, so the group cannot be created.

The second command leaves out the third subgroup and the third entity. The group is successfully created.

### Creation of an Invalid Group
The following command triggers a Sentinel policy violation. The group is not created.
```
vault write Sales/identity/group name=test-sales-2 policies="default" member_group_ids="c81732b0-cea3-3a6c-0a52-d3b4afaca440","0eca3132-c0ec-5807-9014-549fc91fc99e","e9e2a598-0a93-1759-8851-b1a191e6dd9c" member_entity_ids="870a6d92-10f0-55b2-805d-5a3411a8bdd4","93c0685e-5082-2f10-96c8-d0d42c9b1527","96b1876e-dbc7-187a-956e-e4ff035798cd"
```

This gives:
```

```

### Creation of an Allowed Group
The following command does not trigger a Sentinel policy violation. The group is created.
```
vault write Sales/identity/group name=test-sales-2 policies="default" member_group_ids="c81732b0-cea3-3a6c-0a52-d3b4afaca440","0eca3132-c0ec-5807-9014-549fc91fc99e" member_entity_ids="870a6d92-10f0-55b2-805d-5a3411a8bdd4","93c0685e-5082-2f10-96c8-d0d42c9b1527"
```

This returns:
```
Key     Value
---     -----
id      bcacb6d4-3b83-3c62-73e2-88b3e5fea0af
name    test-sales-2
```

## Conclusion
This guide has demonstrated that the Sentinel `http` import allows Sentinel policies in Vault Enterprise 1.5 or higher to make calls against the Vault HTTP API. This makes Sentinel in Vault much more powerful than it was without the `http` import.

We showed two policies that used the `http` import to make calls against three of Vault's HTTP API endpoints related to namespaces, groups, and entities. The first policy generated a map of all namespaces in the Vault cluster. The second policy limited the creation of groups, requiring that all of a group's subgroups and entities belong to the group's namespace or to descendant namespaces of it.

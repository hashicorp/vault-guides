# `.tf` files that contain the word "gitignore" are ignored
# by git in the `.gitignore` file at the root of this repo.

# If you have local Terraform configuration that you want
# ignored like Terraform backend configuration, create
# a new file (separate from this one) that contains the
# word "gitignore" (e.g. `backend.gitignore.tf`).

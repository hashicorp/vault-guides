# Provision a Development Vault Cluster in AWS

The goal of this guide is to allows users to easily provision a development Vault cluster in just a few commands.

## Reference Material

- [Terraform Getting Started](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
- [Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
- [Vault Getting Started](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
- [Vault Docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/index.html)

## Estimated Time to Complete

5 minutes.

## Challenge

There are many different ways to provision and configure an easily accessible development Vault cluster, making it difficult to get started.

## Solution

Provision a development Vault cluster in a public subnet open to the world.

The AWS Development Vault guide is for **educational purposes only**. It's designed to allow you to quickly standup a single instance with Vault running in `-dev` mode. The single node is provisioned into a single public subnet that's completely open, allowing for easy (and insecure) access to the instance. Because Vault is running in `-dev` mode, all data is in-memory and not persisted to disk. If any agent fails or the node restarts, all data will be lost. This is in no way, shape, or form meant for Production use, please use with caution.

## Prerequisites

- [Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Steps

We will now provision the development Vault cluster.

### Step 1: Initialize

Initialize Terraform - download providers and modules.

#### CLI

[`terraform init` Command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html)

##### Request

```sh
$ terraform init
```

##### Response
```
```

### Step 2: Plan

Run a `terraform plan` to ensure Terraform will provision what you expect.

#### CLI

[`terraform plan` Command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)

##### Request

```sh
$ terraform plan
```

##### Response
```
```

### Step 3: Apply

Run a `terraform apply` to provision the HashiStack. One provisioned, view the `zREADME` instructions output from Terraform for next steps.

#### CLI

[`terraform apply` command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)

##### Request

```sh
$ terraform apply
```

##### Response
```
```

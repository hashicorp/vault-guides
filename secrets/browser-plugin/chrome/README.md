# Brower Plugin

These assets are provided to perform the tasks described in the [Vault Secrets
in a Browser Plugin](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/browser-plugin)
tutorial.

This is a fork of the work started by
[Dimitry1987](https://github.com/Dmitry1987) and continued by [Chris
Blum](https://github.com/zeichenanonym).


## Setup

The plugin assumes that you have access to a Vault sever with the userpass
authentication method created. The user that logins needs to have access to the
a KV-V2 secrets engine mounted at the path `vaultpass`.

```shell
vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id root -dev-listen-address 0.0.0.0:8200
vault auth enable userpass
vault secrets enable -path=vaultpass kv-v2
vault policy write vault_pass-policy - <<EOF
path "vaultpass/*" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
EOF

vault write auth/userpass/users/browser \
  password=browser \
  policies=vault_pass-policy

vault kv put vaultpass/extensions username=extension_user password=extension_password
```

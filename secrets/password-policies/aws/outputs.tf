  NOTE: While Terraform's work is done, the Vault server needs time to complete
        its own installation and configuration. Progress is reported within
        the log file `/var/log/tf-user-data.log` and reports 'Complete' when
        the instance is ready.

    - The unseal key is stored in /home/ubuntu/unseal_keys

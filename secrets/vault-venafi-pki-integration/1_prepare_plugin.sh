# Download the current vault-pki-monitor-venafi release zip package for your operating system (https://github.com/Venafi/vault-pki-monitor-venafi/releases/) along with its checksum for the binary. There are two versions of binaries, optional and strict. The "optional" version allows certificates to be issued by the Vault CA when there is no Venafi policy applied whereas the "strict" will return an error when there is no Venafi policy applied, "policy data is nil".

# This command will be run on the Vault binary during a production deploy as well as each plugin since plugins run as a seperate process.
